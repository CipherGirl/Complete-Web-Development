## Notes

* When to use bootstrap:
  * Small to medium projects, very little customization needed.
  * Saving time, short deadline
* When to use vanilla css:
  * For big organizations
  * Too much customizations
  * Have more time..
* Margins things (imporant):
  * m-auto --> This will take the element/container to the middle (aligns center)..
  * me-auto --> Takes all the space from end (right side) so it eventually takes the element/container to the most left
  * ms-auto --> Takes all the space from start (left side) so it eventually takes the element/container to the most right
